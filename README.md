# VotesApp
Voting App, created for CMU's 18-658, Software Engineering and Requirements Design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This is a Node.JS/Angular app, using MongoDB. In order to run them, you should have NodeJs/NPM installed, as well as a local MongoDB instance running.

### Installing

Run

```
npm install
```

in the root folder, and in the public/ folder (`npm install && cd public && npm install`). After that, run
```
npm start
```

To start the server.

Go to http://localhost:8080 to access the application.

### Running the tests

Run
```
npm test
```
to run the test suite.

### Developing
- When developing, use `npm run-script dev` to run the dev server (with nodemon and ng build). It will automatically display changes on the server side, and will display front-end changes upon reloading. 
- When building, use `npm build`
